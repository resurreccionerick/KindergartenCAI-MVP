# Kindergarten CAI (Computer Assisted Instruction) - Capstone Project

Welcome to the Kindergarten CAI (Computer Assisted Instruction) project! This Android application is designed to revolutionize the learning experience for teachers and kindergarten students at Auxillary Academy. By leveraging technology, this project aims to provide alternative methods of learning, teaching, communication, and knowledge acquisition.

## Project Overview

This study endeavors to facilitate teachers in presenting instructional material using computer tools, empowering learners to proceed at their own pace and explore content through various presentations. It seeks to enhance the school's existing system of content delivery techniques and align it with the evolving global learning environment, integrating learning activities with internet and computer technology.

## User Types

1. **Admin:** Manages kindergarten teacher and student accounts.
2. **Teacher:** Adds lessons (videos, sounds, quizzes), monitors student scores in leaderboards, and analyzes quiz performance.
3. **Student:** Learns at their own pace, both online and offline.

## Objectives

- Develop a module to facilitate learner understanding through Computer-Assisted Instruction.
- Create an application to engage kindergarten students in school learning activities.
- Sustain learners' attention with a kid-friendly user interface.
- Integrate modules for teaching writing and cognitive enhancement, even in offline mode.
- Implement modules for school admin to manage teacher and student accounts.
- Enable teachers to add lessons, view scores, and analyze quiz performance.

## Technologies Utilized

The Kindergarten CAI App leverages various architectural patterns and technologies to provide a seamless user experience:

- **MVP Framework:** Separates application logic into Model, View, and Presenter layers, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
- **Java:** A versatile programming language suitable for developing Android apps, ensuring compatibility across multiple platforms.
- **C#:** Utilized in Unity for scripting game behavior and logic, enabling interactive experiences.
- **Firebase:** Provides tools for building and managing mobile and web applications, including user authentication, real-time database integration, cloud storage, and analytics tracking.
